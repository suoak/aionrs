### Subcommands

Management operations live under noun subcommands instead of flat flags. A
subcommand runs its action and exits — it does not start the agent main flow.

|------------|--------------|
| `aionrs config init` | Generate a default global config file |
| `aionrs config path` | Print the global config file path |
| `aionrs auth login` | Login with Anthropic account (OAuth device flow) |
| `aionrs auth logout` | Logout (remove saved OAuth credentials) |
| `aionrs session list` | List saved sessions |
| `aionrs skills path` | Print skill directory paths |

## Configuration

### Three-Level Cascading

```
<global config>                   (global, user-level; run `aionrs config path` to find)
    ↓ overridden by
./.aionrs.toml                  (project-level, working directory)
    ↓ overridden by
CLI parameters / env vars        (highest priority)
```

### Generate Default Config

```bash
aionrs config init
# Creates the global config file (run `aionrs config path` to see the location)
```

### Config File Format

```toml
# Global config file (path varies by OS, use `aionrs config path` to find)

```

### Runtime Limits

`max_turns` is the broad model-turn limit per run. It is unset by default, so
runs have no broad model-turn limit unless you configure one. Set it to `0` to
explicitly disable the broad limit. See [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md) for
the distinction between runs, turns, tool rounds, and tool calls.

`max_tool_call_malformed_turns` limits consecutive same tool-call-malformed
rounds from a provider. The default is `3`; `0` disables this breaker
and leaves stopping to `max_turns` if a broad turn limit is configured.

`max_tool_call_failure_turns` limits consecutive repeats of the same failed
tool name and input pattern. Assistant explanation text does not reset the
count, and successful sibling calls in a mixed round do not erase failures
that are still repeating. A failure-free tool round resets the exact-call and
cycle history. The default is `3`.

The same guard also warns after 3 consecutive all-error rounds and finalizes
after 8, and detects repeating 2-4 round call cycles after 2 repetitions before
finalizing after 3. Setting `max_tool_call_failure_turns` to `0` disables all
of these tool-failure guards and leaves stopping to `max_turns` if a broad turn
limit is configured.

Precedence is `CLI > profile > project config > global config > built-in default 3`. Use `--max-tool-call-malformed-turns <n>` or `--max-tool-call-failure-turns <n>` for a one-off CLI override.

### API Key Resolution Order

1. `--api-key` CLI parameter
2. Config file `providers.<name>.api_key`
3. Env var `API_KEY`
4. Env var `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` (depends on provider)
5. OAuth credentials (via `aionrs auth login`)

> **Note**: `bedrock` and `vertex` providers use their own cloud credentials and do not require a traditional API key. See [Providers & Auth](providers.md).

### Custom Provider Alias

如果某个后端兼容内置 provider 的协议，可以在 `providers.<alias>` 下声明一个 alias：

```toml
[default]
provider = "my-service"

[providers.my-service]
provider = "openai"
model = "custom-model-v1"
api_key = "sk-xxx"
base_url = "https://my-service.example.com/api/openai"
```

- `default.provider` 和 `profile.provider` 都可以写 alias 名称
- `providers.<alias>.provider` 必须声明底层类型，目前只能是 `anthropic`、`openai`、`bedrock`、`vertex`
- alias 条目会覆盖对应底层 provider 的默认配置

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize and Configure

```bash
aionrs config init
# Edit the config file (run `aionrs config path` to find it), add your API key
```

### 2. Single-Shot Mode

```bash
aionrs "Read and explain crates/aion-agent/src/engine.rs"
```

### 3. Interactive terminal UI

```bash
aionrs
```

When stdin and stdout are attached to a terminal, `aionrs` keeps finalized
conversation in native terminal scrollback and renders an inline composer at
the bottom, with streaming responses, tool activity, and in-place approval
prompts. Type `/` at the beginning of the composer to
open the command popup, continue typing to filter it, use Up/Down to move, and
press Tab to complete or Enter to run the selected command.

Each thinking segment starts with `•`. Consecutive tool calls are collected
under a single `• Tools` step and appended as nested rows, so a batch remains
easy to scan without losing its individual calls. Tool rows update in place as
`queued`, `approval`, `running`, `done`, `failed`, or `cancelled`; the status
label and semantic color change together. Tool input and output are displayed
as a responsive one-line preview, while the full value remains in the saved
conversation.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Enter | Send the current message |
| Shift+Enter | Insert a newline (Ctrl+J is available as a fallback) |
| Up/Down | Select a slash command |
| Mouse wheel | Scroll finalized conversation in the terminal's native scrollback |
| Ctrl+C | Stop the active turn; clear a draft or quit while idle |
| Ctrl+D | Quit while the composer is empty |

Mouse capture is deliberately disabled. Drag across any visible conversation
text and use the terminal's normal copy shortcut (`Cmd+C` on macOS or usually
`Ctrl+Shift+C` on Linux/Windows terminals).

Agent commands are `/compact`, `/context`, `/clear`, `/help`, and `/quit`.
The interactive UI also provides:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Show provider, model, session, permission mode, and context usage |
| `/model [name]` | Show the current model or switch to a model ID |
| `/permissions [default\|auto_edit\|yolo]` | Show or change the tool approval mode |
| `/new` | Start a new session without exiting the interactive UI |
| `/resume [id\|latest]` | Open the session picker or resume an ID in place |
| `/mcp` | Show connected MCP servers and tool counts |
| `/skills` | Show model-visible skills loaded for the current runtime |

The session picker replaces the conversation with a focused full-screen list.
Use the mouse wheel or Up/Down to move, Enter to resume, and Esc to close it.
All saved sessions are shown in last-update order; the number retained on disk
is controlled by `session.max_sessions` (20 by default).
Resumed conversations are restored into the terminal's native scrollback. Use
the mouse wheel to move between the earliest and latest turns.

`/help` combines both command groups. `/exit` is an alias for `/quit`. Empty
messages no longer exit interactive mode. Model switching accepts an explicit
model ID; an interactive model candidate picker is not available yet.

When input or output is redirected, `aionrs` keeps the plain line-oriented REPL
for compatibility with scripts and terminals that do not support the interactive UI.

### 4. Switching Profiles

```bash
aionrs --profile deepseek "Fix the bug in main.rs"
aionrs --profile ollama "Analyze code quality"
```

### 5. Environment Variables

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx
aionrs "List all Rust files in this project"
```

---

## Tool Confirmation

Tools that require approval are displayed in an in-place dialog in the terminal
UI. Press `y` or Enter to allow once, `a` to allow the category for the rest of
the session, or `n`/Esc to deny. The plain REPL uses the equivalent text prompt:

```
[tool] Write({"file_path": "/tmp/test.rs", "content": "..."})
Allow? [y]es / [n]o / [a]lways / [q]uit > y
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `y` / `yes` / Enter | Allow this execution |
| `n` / `no` | Deny — LLM receives a "denied" error |
| `a` / `always` | Auto-approve this tool for the rest of the session |
| `q` / `quit` | Abort the entire agent run |

- Read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob) are auto-approved by default
- `--auto-approve` skips all confirmations
- `tools.allow_list` in config customizes the whitelist

---

## Session Management

Sessions auto-save to `.aionrs/sessions/<session-id>/state.json`. Sessions
created by versions that used the duplicated
`.aionrs/sessions/sessions/<session-id>/state.json` layout remain readable and
are copied to the normalized location when resumed.

```bash
# List saved sessions
aionrs session list

# Resume the latest session
aionrs --resume latest

# Resume a specific session
aionrs --resume a1b2c3

# Fork a session: copy its history into a new session id and continue
# there, leaving the original session untouched
aionrs --resume a1b2c3 --fork-session

# Create a session with a custom ID
aionrs --session-id my-conv-123
```

- `--session-id` and `--resume` are mutually exclusive
- `--fork-session` requires `--resume`; the forked session records its
  parent in `forked_from` and the fork-tree root in `root_id`
- `--session-id` errors if the ID already exists
- Both flags work in interactive and `--json-stream` mode
- Auto-saves after each tool round
- Auto-cleans oldest sessions when exceeding `max_sessions`
